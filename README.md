## üéØ SQL Query Breakdown

This SQL query retrieves information about the top-paying **Data Analyst** jobs that are located in **Anywhere**, based on average yearly salary. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part of the query:

## üìã **SELECT Clause**
The query selects the following fields from the `job_postings_fact` table and its related `company_dim` table:
- **job_id**: Unique identifier for the job.
- **job_title**: The title of the job (in this case, it will always be "Data Analyst").
- **job_location**: The location of the job (in this case, it will always be "Anywhere").
- **job_schedule_type**: The type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time).
- **salary_year_avg**: The average yearly salary for the job.
- **job_posted_date**: The date when the job was posted.
- **company_name**: The name of the company, retrieved from the `company_dim` table.

## üîó **LEFT JOIN Clause**
The query uses a `LEFT JOIN` to combine data from two tables:
- **job_postings_fact**: The main table containing job posting data.
- **company_dim**: A dimension table that holds company information. The join is based on the `company_id` field, which exists in both tables.

This `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a job posting doesn‚Äôt have a corresponding company in the `company_dim` table, the job data will still be included in the result (with a `NULL` company name).

## üß≥ **WHERE Clause**
The query filters the results based on specific conditions:
- **job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'**: Only retrieves job postings with the title "Data Analyst".
- **job_location = 'Anywhere'**: Only retrieves job postings where the job location is set to "Anywhere".
- **salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL**: Ensures that only job postings with a non-null average yearly salary are included in the results.

## üèÜ **ORDER BY Clause**
- **salary_year_avg DESC**: Sorts the results in descending order by the average yearly salary, so the highest-paying jobs appear first.

## üîü **LIMIT Clause**
- **LIMIT 10**: Limits the results to the top 10 highest-paying jobs, ensuring the query returns a concise list of the best opportunities.

## üöÄ **Summary**
This query is designed to quickly extract the top 10 **Data Analyst** jobs in "Anywhere," focusing on those that offer the highest salaries. It combines information from two tables and applies filters and sorting to present the most valuable job opportunities first.

Combines the `job_postings_fact` table with the `company_dim` table based on the `company_id`, ensuring that even jobs without a company entry in `company_dim` will still be included in the result set.

## üß≥ WHERE Clause
Filters to only include **Data Analyst** jobs located "Anywhere" with a non-null average salary.

## üèÜ ORDER BY
Sorts the data by the average yearly salary in descending order, so the highest-paying jobs appear first.

## üîü LIMIT Clause
Limits the result set to the top 10 highest-paying jobs.

## üìù Main Query
In the main query, the `top_paying_jobs` result set is used to fetch additional data, specifically the skills required for each job.

```sql
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
## üîç INNER JOIN Clauses
- **INNER JOIN skills_job_dim**: Links the `top_paying_jobs` with the `skills_job_dim` table using the `job_id` to find the skills required for each job.

    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = True 
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), 
average_salary AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE

        AND job_work_from_home = True 
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

```

### üîç What's Happening Here?

1. We create two CTEs: `skills_demand` (counting job postings per skill) and `average_salary` (calculating average salary per skill).
2. The main query joins these CTEs to combine demand and salary data.
3. We filter for skills with more than 10 job postings to ensure significance.
4. Results are ordered first by salary, then by demand, to find the optimal balance.
5. We limit to the top 25 skills to focus on the most valuable opportunities.

### üí° Why This Matters

This query is your career compass! It identifies skills that are both in high demand and associated with high salaries. These are the golden skills that offer the best return on investment for your learning efforts, potentially leading to numerous job opportunities and attractive compensation packages.
# Another way 

This query extracts the top 25 most demanded skills from two tables, `skills_demand` and `average_salary`, based on their salary and demand count. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the query:

## Tables Involved:
1. **skills_demand**: Contains data about different skills and the number of job postings requiring each skill (`demand_count`).
2. **average_salary**: Contains data about the average salary (`avg_salary`) associated with each skill.

Both tables are related by `skill_id`, a unique identifier for each skill.

## Query Breakdown:

```sql
SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary 
    ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    demand_count > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
1. **SELECT Clause**
   - **skills_demand.skill_id**: Fetches the unique ID of each skill.
   - **skills_demand.skills**: Fetches the name of each skill.
   - **demand_count**: Retrieves the number of job postings requiring each skill.
   - **avg_salary**: Fetches the average salary offered for each skill.

2. **INNER JOIN**
   The query uses an `INNER JOIN` to combine data from both tables based on the `skill_id`. Only records that exist in both `skills_demand` and `average_salary` will be included in the results.

3. **WHERE Clause**
   - **demand_count > 10**: Filters out skills that are not in high demand (i.e., with less than 10 job postings).

4. **ORDER BY**
   - **avg_salary DESC**: Sorts the results by the average salary in descending order, showing the highest-paying skills first.
   - **demand_count DESC**: Further sorts the results by demand count in descending order, so that for skills with the same average salary, the one with the higher demand appears first.

5. **LIMIT**
   - **LIMIT 25**: Limits the results to the top 25 most in-demand skills, ensuring the list is manageable and focused on the highest-paying and most demanded skills.

## Summary:
This query is perfect for generating insights into the most valuable skills in the job market, focusing on both demand and salary. By sorting the results first by salary and then by demand, it helps identify not only the skills that are in high demand but also the ones that offer the best financial compensation.
